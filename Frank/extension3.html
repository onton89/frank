                              Every animal reaching FRANK unable to return to its own territory and sustain on its own becomes a part of our FRANK family until they are taken to a furever home. If not, they will remain our forever angel embraced by our magical spell of love, care and affection. They will no longer roam around the streets in the fear of being subjected to horrendous cruelty; no longer shall they remain hungry, fatigued and emaciated.


                              Now they will have a cozy bed to sleep rather than the dirty concrete floors or roads; they will be surrounded by people who really care for them rather than those who pelt stones at them. The shelter animals have about 5 acres of land surrounded by river on 3 sides to roam, play, doze in and investigate throughout the day.


                              FRANK is home to _ dogs, _ cats, _ goats, _ rabbits, _hens, _ducks  and _ guinea pigs.


                              The animals eventually identify their companions and form their own territories. It is interesting to find them making bonds with each other and resolving quarrels with their playmates in their own weird ways.


                              One thing is certain, they are never going to be alone and uncared ever after</p>
