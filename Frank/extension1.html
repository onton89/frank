                          <h4>STREET ANIMAL RESCUE</h4>
                                                        
                          <p>FRANK encourages people to care for and rescue street animals. We proposes a holistic rescue strategy for injured and ill ownerless street animals in and around Kottayam. Since our inception we have rescued the precious lives of approximately 100 angels. The emergencies we respond to range from animals injured after being hit by a vehicle; to wounds, tumor, manges; to head being stuck in bottle and other illnesses; trapped in a well and to cases of abuse.</p>
                              <p>FRANK is the first of its kind in Kottayam. Animal lovers need not despair now when they find an animal in distress begging for help. FRANK is always at their disposal. The animals in pain are brought to the shelter by volunteers. The informers also aid us in the rescue by coaxing an injured animal into a confined space to make sure we are able to find and catch the animal. The injured animal is then given proper medical assistance and is let to recuperate till they are ready to go back to their own areas.</p>
                               <p>FRANK aids in their speedy recoveries through the magical wand of love. Our volunteers and staff calm scared animals and reduce their stress by encouraging sick or anxious animals to eat, by providing warmth, giving baths, physical exercise, and most crucially, by giving love, care and affection.</p>
                                <p>If the animal has fully recovered and is able to sustain on its own in the street, they are returned to the same spot where from they were rescued.</p>
