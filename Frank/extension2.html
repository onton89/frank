                              One of the major concerns of the state is the alarming rise in the population of stray animals. This would pose a threat to their chances of survival. Availability of food is limited. Puppies may survive on mother’s milk during the initial stage. Once they enter their second month of life, their mothers’ milk is no longer enough to feed them. Roaming around the streets in search of food makes them fatigued and in turn malnourished. 
                          
                              FRANK believe that the most relevant thing we can do to save cats and dogs from all the suffering and death that their overpopulation causes is to spay and neuter them. We have sterilized about 50 animals so  far. We strive to improve the lives of animals by advocating Trap-Neuter-Release as the humane and effective way of the population control. 
                              
                              Spaying and neutering are routine, affordable surgeries that can prevent thousands of animals from being born, only to suffer and struggle to survive on the streets, be abused by cruel or neglectful people.
                              
                              Spaying and neutering makes a big difference: Just one unaltered female dog and her offspring can produce 67,000 puppies in only six years. In seven years, one female cat and her offspring can produce an incredible 370,000 kittens!
                              
                              During a spay or neuter surgery, dogs and cats are fully anesthetized, so they feel no pain. Afterwards, most animals seem to experience some discomfort, but signs of discomfort disappear within a few days, and with pain management medication, pain may not be experienced at all. All the animals are released back in their own vicinity with the help of volunteers.
